nuitka (0.3.15pre2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lowered dependency for Scons to what Ubuntu Oneiric has and
    what we have as an inline copy, (scons >=2.0.1) should be
    sufficient.

nuitka (0.3.15pre2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some review feedback on the Debian package.
  * Recommend python-lxml, as it's used by Nuitka to dump XML
    representation.
  * Recommend python-qt4, as it may be used to display the node
    tree in a window.
  * Repair cut off short description
  * Removed inline copy of Scons from the package.
  * Added patch to remove the setting nuitka package in sys.path,
    not needed in Debian.
