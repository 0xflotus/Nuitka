nuitka (0.3.18+ds-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Lowered dependencies so that a backport to Ubuntu Natty and
    higher is now feasible. A "scons >=2.0.0" is good enough,
    and so is "g++-4.5" as well.
  * Don't require the PDF generation to be successful on older
    Ubuntu versions as it crashes due to old "rst2pdf" bugs.

nuitka (0.3.17+ds-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Updated man page to use new "--recurse-*" options in examples
    over removed "--deep*" options.
  * Completed copyright file according to "licensecheck" findings
    and updated files accordingly. Put the included tests owned
    by upstream into public domain.
  * Use a "+ds" file as orig source with inline copy of Scons
    already removed instead of doing it as a patch.
  * Also removed the benchmark tests from "+ds" file, not useful
    to be provided with Nuitka.
  * Added syntax tests, these were omitted by mistake previously.
  * Run the test suite at package build time, it checks the basic
    tests, syntax error tests, program tests, and the compile
    itself test.
  * Added run time dependencies also as build time dependencies
    to be able to execute the tests.
  * Corrected handling of upstream pre-release names in the watch
    file.
  * Changed contributor notice to only require "Apache License 2.0"
    for the new parts.
  * Put Debian packaging and owned tests under "Apache License 2.0"
    as well.

nuitka (0.3.15-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Renamed "/usr/bin/Python" to "/usr/bin/nuitka-python".
  * Added man pages for "nuitka" and "nuitka-python", the first
    with an examples section that shows the most important uses
    of the "nuitka" binary.
  * Removed foreign code for Windows generators, removed from
    debian/copyright.
  * Lowered dependency for Scons to what Ubuntu Oneiric has and
    what we have as an inline copy, (scons >=2.0.1) should be
    sufficient.
  * Recommend python-lxml, as it's used by Nuitka to dump XML
    representation.
  * Recommend python-qt4, as it may be used to display the node
    tree in a window.
  * Removed inline copy of Scons from the binary package.
  * Added patch to remove the setting nuitka package in sys.path,
    not needed in Debian.
