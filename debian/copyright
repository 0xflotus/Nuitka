 Part of "Nuitka", an optimizing Python compiler that is compatible and
 integrates with CPython, but also works on its own.
 .
 If you submit Kay Hayen patches to this software in either form, you
 automatically grant him a copyright assignment to the code, or in the
 alternative a BSD license to the code, should your jurisdiction prevent
 this. Obviously it won't affect code that comes to him indirectly or
 code you don't submit to him.
 .
 This is to reserve my ability to re-license the code at any time, e.g.
 the PSF. With this version of Nuitka, using it for Closed Source will
 not be allowed.
