#     Part of "Nuitka", an optimizing Python compiler that is compatible and
#     integrates with CPython, but also works on its own.
#
#     If you submit Kay Hayen patches to this software in either form, you
#     automatically grant him a copyright assignment to the code, or in the
#     alternative a BSD license to the code, should your jurisdiction prevent
#     this. Obviously it won't affect code that comes to him indirectly or
#     code you don't submit to him.
#
#     This is to reserve my ability to re-license the code at a later time to
#     the PSF. With this version of Nuitka, using it for a Closed Source and
